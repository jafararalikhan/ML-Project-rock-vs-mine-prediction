# Rock vs Mine Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project is focused on developing a machine learning model capable of differentiating between sonar signals bounced off a rock and those from a mine. Using logistic regression, the model is trained on a dataset of sonar signal patterns, each labeled as either 'Rock' or 'Mine'. This project aims to accurately predict the nature of underwater objects based on their sonar signatures.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to determine whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine using sonar return data. We employ a dataset that consists of patterns obtained by bouncing sonar signals off both a metal cylinder (representing a mine) and a rock under similar conditions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

### Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jafararalikhan/ML-Project-rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the prediction model, execute:
```bash
python model.py
```
This script trains the logistic regression model using the provided dataset and evaluates its performance.

## Dataset
The dataset features sonar signal strengths recorded under various angles and conditions. Each record in the dataset comprises a sequence of signal strengths, followed by a label indicating whether the signals were reflected off a rock or a mine.

## Model
We selected the logistic regression model for its simplicity and efficiency in binary classification tasks. The model learns to differentiate between the sonar signatures of rocks and mines, providing a straightforward yet powerful tool for underwater object classification.

## Evaluation
We assess the model's accuracy using several metrics, including precision, recall, and the F1 score, with accuracy being the primary metric. These evaluations help ensure the reliability and effectiveness of our predictive model.
